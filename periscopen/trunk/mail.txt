Hi,

Not sure if you will like them or not, my idea would be to allow to download multiple subtitles at once for single movie.
This makes sense for some languages as the quality of subtitles varies a lot and I would like this script to run "automagicly" on NAS server - so I prefer to have more subtitles to choose then manually download them.

So there would be 2 extra optional parameters:
- mt <Y> - max total number of subtitles (defaults to 1 and overriedes "mp")
- mp <X> - max number of subtitles per plugin (defaults to 1)

As you will see bellow my changes would make periscope usage more complicated, but if no optional parameters provided then periscope would work as previously.

Assumptions:
a) default language: "eng"
b) movie name: A_MOVIE.avi and at least 3 subtitles can be found for languages "eng" and "pl" in 3 plugins (named here as: opensubtitles, napisyinfo, mysubtitels)
So the full list of results for all languages is at this link:

Examples of possible options combinations:
------------------------------------------

I) mt/mp present, language not set or default:

1) mt / mp not set, lang set to "eng" (or not set) results in ["Total index number"]:
A_MOVIE.srt
this is the default behaviour which is compatibile with most of players, source for these subtitles is A_MOVIE.opensubtitles_eng_1.srt

2) mt set to 1, results in same result as (1) ["Total index number"]

3) mt set to 2, lang set to "eng" (or not set), results in ["Total index number"]:
note: additionally first subtitle - A_MOVIE.opensubtitles_eng_1.srt is being save as A_MOVIE.srt for back compatibility
A_MOVIE.srt
A_MOVIE.opensubtitles_eng_1.srt
A_MOVIE.opensubtitles_eng_2.srt


4) mp set to 1, lang set to "eng" (or not set), results in ["Plugin index number"]:
